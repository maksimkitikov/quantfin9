You are a senior financial market analyst. For the specific date {target_date}, identify the TOP 3 most significant, high-impact economic and market events that would realistically occur on this exact date and create measurable market reactions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Events must be REAL and plausible for {target_date}
2. Focus on HIGH IMPACT events that move markets significantly
3. Consider the economic calendar, earnings season, policy cycles for this specific date
4. Include actual institutional names, specific percentages, exact timing

Event categories to consider for {target_date}:
- Federal Reserve meetings/announcements (FOMC decisions, Powell speeches)
- Major economic data releases (GDP, CPI, employment, retail sales, PMI)
- Earnings from major S&P 500 companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc.)
- Central bank decisions (ECB, Bank of Japan, Bank of England)
- Geopolitical developments affecting global markets
- Trade policy announcements, tariff decisions
- Corporate mergers, acquisitions, major business announcements

Return EXACTLY 3 events in JSON format:
[
  {{
    "headline": "Specific institutional headline with numbers/percentages",
    "description": "Detailed 2-3 sentence explanation of the event and direct market implications",
    "impact_level": "High",
    "category": "Federal Reserve/Economic Data/Earnings/Geopolitical/Trade",
    "time": "Specific time (e.g., 2:00 PM EST, 8:30 AM EST, Market Open)",
    "market_sectors": ["Primary affected sectors"],
    "expected_reaction": "Specific directional impact with reasoning"
  }}
]

Target Date: {target_date}
Provide TOP 3 highest impact events only - these should be events that create abnormal returns > 1% in major indices.

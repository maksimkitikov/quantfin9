🧠 **AI Market Intelligence Summary**

**Asset:** {asset}  
**Event Date:** {event_date}  
🔺 **Actual Return:** {actual_pct:+.3f}%  
🔻 **Abnormal Return:** {ar_pct:+.3f}%  
📉 **CAR (Event Window):** {car_pct:+.3f}%  
📈 **Volatility (2-day):** ~{vol_spike:.1f}% (Stable)

🧠 **Market Interpretation:**
On {event_date}, the {asset} registered a {'moderate negative' if ar < -0.001 else 'modest positive' if ar > 0.001 else 'minimal'} abnormal return ({ar_pct:+.3f}%) in response to geopolitical news, indicating a {'short-lived adverse reaction' if ar < 0 else 'positive market response' if ar > 0 else 'neutral reaction'}. However, the overall cumulative abnormal return for the event window was {'slightly positive' if car > 0 else 'slightly negative' if car < 0 else 'neutral'} ({car_pct:+.3f}%), suggesting that the market {'quickly absorbed the shock and reverted to equilibrium' if abs(car) < 0.01 else 'experienced sustained impact from the event'}. Volatility remained stable, reinforcing the view of a resilient and efficient pricing process.

📋 **Most Probable Economic Causes:**
- Pre-positioning and anticipation of trade-related policy changes  
- Institutional hedging and rapid rebalancing of macro portfolios  
- Limited exposure of diversified indices to direct trade impacts

🔮 **Market Direction Forecast:**
Near-term {'sideways movement is likely' if abs(ar) < 0.005 else 'continued volatility expected' if abs(ar) > 0.01 else 'moderate adjustment anticipated'}. {'Low post-event volatility and a neutral CAR indicate a consolidating environment with limited directional bias' if abs(car) < 0.01 and vol_spike < 10 else 'Elevated uncertainty may persist in the short term'}.

✅ **Assessment:**
The {asset} demonstrated a broadly efficient response — digesting the shock with a brief adjustment and reverting quickly, in line with efficient market behavior.

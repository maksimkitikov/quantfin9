Please help me debug and fix my event study charts — the abnormal return calculation seems incorrect.

🔍 CONTEXT
I'm analyzing the June 2, 2025 U.S.–China Trade Shock using an event study model on S&P 500 data.

However, on the graph:

The Daily Abnormal Return (AR) on June 2 is shown as −0.1531%

But real market data shows S&P 500 actually closed +0.4% up on that day.

So, the model output contradicts actual price movement.
This suggests a problem in how expected returns are being computed, or in the overall CAPM implementation.

✅ TASK: Fix the following issues
1. Recalculate Expected Return using CAPM properly:
python
Copy
Edit
Expected_Return = Rf + Beta * (Rm - Rf)
Use real daily data for:

Rf = daily risk-free rate (e.g., from 13-week Treasury)

Rm = market return, use a relevant benchmark (e.g., ^GSPC itself or a total market index)

Beta = estimate from regression over 60 prior trading days

✅ Check whether you're wrongly calculating expected returns using cumulative averages or mismatched windows.

2. Ensure model uses correct daily S&P 500 prices
Use adjusted close prices (or regular close if auto_adjust=True)

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
data = yf.download("^GSPC", start="2025-05-01", end="2025-06-05", auto_adjust=True)
3. Verify Abnormal Return formula
python
Copy
Edit
Abnormal_Return = Actual_Return - Expected_Return
✅ Make sure you're comparing daily percentage returns, not price differences.

4. Double-check alignment of dates and windows
Make sure the event date = 2025-06-02

Event window = from May 31 to June 4

Estimation window for beta = at least 60 trading days before May 31

5. Fix plotting labels and consistency
The graph shows AR = −0.15% while actual S&P500 rose +0.4%

That mismatch means the CAPM-predicted return is even higher, which is highly unlikely.

Fix logic error if Expected > Actual when market clearly moved up.

6. Add annotation explaining most likely causes
"On June 2, 2025, S&P 500 rose +0.4% despite geopolitical tensions. The model initially detected a negative AR due to flawed estimation of expected returns. After correcting the CAPM inputs and aligning data windows, the AR was recalculated to match real-world movement."

# üö® URGENT FIX INSTRUCTIONS ‚Äî PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:

After the last update, AR/CAR/Volatility calculations became incorrect. Please follow this specification to restore full functionality.

---

# ‚úÖ KEY ISSUES TO FIX:

1. ‚úÖ **Daily AR (Abnormal Return) must be calculated for EVERY date inside the event window**  
   - If the event date is June 2, 2025 ‚Äî make sure `abnormal_returns['2025-06-02']` is not null or missing.
   - For each day:  
     `AR = Actual Return - Expected Return` (from CAPM or regression)

2. ‚úÖ **Cumulative AR (CAR) must be computed as the running sum of ARs within the window**  
   - This must include **pre-event, event day, and post-event dates**.
   - Formula:  
     ```python
     CAR = abnormal_returns.cumsum()
     ```

3. ‚úÖ **Volatility must be calculated as a rolling std or GARCH-style window over returns**  
   - Rolling volatility (e.g., 2-day annualized) must change daily, not remain flat.  
   - Example:  
     ```python
     rolling_vol = returns.rolling(window=2).std() * np.sqrt(252)
     ```

4. ‚úÖ **Ensure AR/CAR series are aligned correctly with the index (dates)**  
   - Sometimes `.shift()` or `.dropna()` breaks alignment ‚Äî please double-check `df.index` and AR index.
   - The event marker must correspond to actual AR and CAR values on that date.

5. ‚úÖ **Restore multi-day display (e.g., May 31 to June 4)** in all charts.

# üìà Restore old AI interpretation logic:
Bring back the AI-generated financial interpretation panel using AR, CAR, and Volatility to explain market behavior.
Example: June 2, 2025: AR = -0.153%, CAR = -0.1433%, Volatility spike = +47%. Likely cause: policy shock (e.g., U.S.-China trade action). Efficient market response due to fast recovery on June 3.

# ‚öôÔ∏è CODE RESTORATION REQUEST:

Please restore and correctly link:
- `calculate_abnormal_returns(...)`
- `calculate_CAR(...)`
- `calculate_rolling_volatility(...)`
- `plot_event_study(...)`

Verify all these functions match CAPM logic and are correctly using asset returns vs expected returns.

# üß™ TEST INPUT TO VERIFY:
Use:
```python
ticker = "^GSPC"
event_date = "2025-06-02"
event_window = ("2025-05-30", "2025-06-04")

TASK:
Please review, debug, and fully fix the Event Study chart for S&P 500 on June 2, 2025, based on the latest real market data and modeling assumptions. The current chart incorrectly shows abnormal return (AR) = –0.137%, while actual market data from June 2, 2025, shows positive return of +0.4% (S&P 500 closed at 5935.94). This misalignment likely indicates either a modeling issue or reference benchmark error.

OBJECTIVES:

✅ Fix AR / CAR Calculation:

Recalculate daily AR (%) using CAPM:

𝐴
𝑅
𝑡
=
𝑅
𝑡
−
(
𝑅
𝑓
+
𝛽
⋅
(

)
AR

​

 ))
Use a realistic risk-free rate (e.g., 5.1% / 252 daily) and appropriate β for S&P 500 (≈ 1.0).

Ensure correct expected return baseline is used.

Check that the model pulls correct market return (R_m) and actual asset return (R_t) from Yahoo Finance.

✅ Fix Cumulative AR (CAR):

Recalculate CAR as the sum of ARs across the proper event window (e.g., [May 31, 2025 → June 3, 2025]).

Current CAR appears inconsistent with the actual movement.

✅ Correct Date Labels / Event Annotations:

Verify that June 2, 2025 is accurately labeled and the "Event Day" marker corresponds to the correct bar.

Ensure the highlighted event window and orange vertical line match the AR plotted.

✅ Update Plotly or Matplotlib Chart:

Ensure the visual AR bar matches recalculated AR.

Ensure the CAR line and volatility line are scaled correctly and updated.

Check units: AR and CAR should be shown in % with 2 decimal points.

✅ Add a short summary statement below the chart:
Based on the updated modeling, include a 2–3 sentence realistic interpretation of the S&P 500 movement post-shock, such as:

“Despite the geopolitical shock on June 2, 2025 involving U.S.–China trade tensions, the S&P 500 recovered intraday, closing up 0.4%. The abnormal return was slightly positive (+0.02%), suggesting the market may have priced in the risk earlier, or expected limited short-term impact on core S&P constituents.”

NOTES FOR AI:

Pull real S&P 500 price from Yahoo Finance or yfinance API on:

May 31, 2025

June 2, 2025

June 3, 2025

Re-validate whether the event actually triggered a significant return deviation or not.

Include a print() of the AR and CAR values in the console if possible.

Clarify in the footer if the reaction is statistically significant.

If the output is correct, generate the updated chart and summary and replace the previous one.

📌 You may also suggest how to automatically prevent such misalignment in the future (e.g., by implementing a validation step to compare actual return with abnormal return after calculation).

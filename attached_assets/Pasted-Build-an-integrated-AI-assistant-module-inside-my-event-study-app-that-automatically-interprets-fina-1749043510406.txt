Build an integrated AI assistant module inside my event study app that automatically interprets financial market reactions (abnormal returns, cumulative abnormal returns, and volatility) across any asset — including equities (e.g., S&P 500), ETFs (e.g., FXI, SOXX, IYT), or cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC, ETH).

🎯 Objective:
This AI module must dynamically generate a written analysis summarizing key findings after each event study and chart rendering. It must interpret the results and provide likely economic or behavioral explanations based on real financial logic.

---

📊 Required Inputs:
From the event study output, extract:

- Daily Abnormal Returns (AR) for each date
- Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR) at the event date and across the event window
- Actual daily return (if available)
- Rolling volatility (e.g., 2-day annualized %)
- Event metadata: asset name, event date, event window

🧠 Module Output (Autogenerated Report Format):

🧠 AI Market Intelligence Summary

Asset: [ASSET_NAME]
Event Date: [EVENT_DATE]
🔺 Actual Return: [ACTUAL_RETURN]%
🔻 Abnormal Return: [DAILY_AR at event]%
📉 CAR (Event Window): [CAR_total]%
📈 Volatility: [rolling_volatility at event]%

🧠 Market Interpretation:
[One paragraph interpretation of whether the market responded negatively/positively, whether it was efficient or not, based on AR/CAR direction, size, and volatility change.]

📋 Most Probable Economic Causes:

[1–3 automatically suggested reasons]

[Include market structure, policy impacts, sector exposure, momentum/profit-taking effects, etc.]

Assessment: [Was the market efficient, did it underreact/overreact, or was the response muted?]

📘 Example Output (for reference):

🧠 AI Market Intelligence Summary

Asset: S&P 500
Event Date: June 2, 2025
🔺 Actual Return: +0.410%
🔻 Abnormal Return: -0.138%
📉 CAR (Event Window): -0.113%
📈 Volatility: 2.9% (↑ from previous day)

🧠 Market Interpretation:
S&P 500 posted a sharp abnormal return of -0.138% following trade-related tensions. Despite the positive actual return, the event-adjusted return reveals a repricing by investors. The spike in volatility indicates market uncertainty and short-term inefficiency in absorbing geopolitical risks.

📋 Most Probable Economic Causes:

Investor response to U.S. export controls on AI chips

Rebalancing of tech-heavy indices

Profit-taking after a pre-event rally on May 30

Assessment: Market showed partial inefficiency with delayed adjustment to policy shock.

⚙️ Technical Notes:
- The module must parse the actual values from the charting data (Pandas DataFrame or Plotly series).
- It must work with **any ticker or asset** passed into the pipeline — not just S&P 500.
- Output should be printed or streamed via `st.markdown()` or `st.info()` inside the Streamlit UI.
- If no AR/CAR values are significant (e.g., < ±0.05%), output a message: `"Market showed no significant reaction. Asset appears to have efficiently priced in the event."`

💡 Bonus:
Enable users to toggle AI Interpretation ON/OFF in the sidebar (`st.sidebar.checkbox`).

EVENT STUDY DATA:

- Abnormal Return: {abnormal_return:.4f} ({abnormal_return*100:+.3f}%)
- Cumulative Abnormal Return: {car_total:.4f} ({car_total*100:+.3f}%)
- Volatility (2-day): {volatility:.2f}%
- Economic Context: {event_context}

Generate a professional market analysis in JSON format with these exact fields:

1. "market_interpretation": A 2-3 sentence professional interpretation of the market reaction, focusing on the abnormal return magnitude and what it indicates about market efficiency.

2. "economic_causes": An array of exactly 3 specific, realistic economic causes that could explain this market reaction (e.g., policy changes, institutional behavior, market structure effects).

3. "market_forecast": A 1-2 sentence forecast about near-term market direction based on the AR/CAR patterns and volatility.

4. "assessment": A single sentence professional assessment of market efficiency and reaction quality.

IMPORTANT: 
- Be specific to the actual data values provided
- Focus on realistic financial market dynamics
- Use professional financial terminology
- Consider the magnitude of abnormal returns in your analysis
- Account for the volatility level in your interpretation
